# Automated Scoring System for LLM-Generated Biomedical Hypotheses

## Introduction and Motivation

Biomedical research is increasingly assisted by AI, with large language models (LLMs) now capable of generating scientific hypotheses at scale ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=intensified%20by%20the%20rise%20of,including%20biology%2C%20economics%2C%20and%20sociology)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=The%20rapid%20growth%20of%20biomedical,tier%20instructed%20models%20in%20zero)). However, an explosion of _millions_ of AI-proposed hypotheses poses a validation bottleneck. Manually reviewing each hypothesis is impractical ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=intensified%20by%20the%20rise%20of,including%20biology%2C%20economics%2C%20and%20sociology)), especially since LLMs can hallucinate plausible-sounding but unsubstantiated ideas ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=intensified%20by%20the%20rise%20of,We)). There is a critical need for an automated, high-accuracy scoring system that can **evaluate biomedical hypotheses** with minimal human intervention, triaging the most promising ones for researchers. This report outlines a system that assigns a score (0–100) to each hypothesis based on well-defined scientific criteria, prioritizing **testability, falsifiability, novelty, biological plausibility, and relevance**. The goal is a **scalable pipeline** that integrates LLM-based analysis with biomedical knowledge sources to rigorously assess hypothesis quality, while allowing optional human oversight for edge cases. We draw on recent advances in autonomous science (e.g. the _Popper_ agentic framework for hypothesis falsification ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore))) and evaluations of LLM-generated hypotheses ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Significance%3A%20What%20impact%20does%20the,understanding%20or%20addressing%20the%20problem)) to inform our design.

## Scoring Criteria and Schema

We define five primary criteria that reflect core scientific principles and domain considerations. Each hypothesis will be evaluated along these dimensions, and a weighted sum (totaling 100) yields the final score. **Table 1** summarizes the criteria, weights, and scoring guidelines:

| **Criterion**               | **Weight** | **Description & Scoring Guidelines**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testability**             | 20%        | Assesses whether the hypothesis can be empirically tested with current or foreseeable techniques. High score if concrete experiments or data could readily confirm/deny it; low if it is vague or not practically testable ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Significance%3A%20What%20impact%20does%20the,understanding%20or%20addressing%20the%20problem)).                               |
| **Falsifiability**          | 20%        | Evaluates if the hypothesis can be clearly disproven by evidence (Karl Popper’s criterion of demarcation). High if specific observations could invalidate it; low if it’s unfalsifiable or tautological ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore)).                                                                         |
| **Novelty**                 | 20%        | Measures how original or innovative the hypothesis is relative to existing knowledge. High for genuinely new mechanistic insights not obvious from prior work; low if it’s a trivial extension of known findings ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)).                                                                                                                                     |
| **Biological Plausibility** | 20%        | Checks consistency with established biological facts and mechanisms. High if it fits known pathways or empirical data (and does not contradict fundamental biology); low if it conflicts with well-established science or lacks any supporting rationale ([Large-Scale Validation of Hypothesis Generation Systems via Candidate Ranking - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9248026/#:~:text=evaluation%20framework%20for%20the%20purpose,generate%20a%20set%20of%20candidate)). |
| **Relevance**               | 20%        | Judges the hypothesis’s relevance to current scientific questions and evidence. High if it addresses important problems or aligns with recent findings (e.g. built on existing abstracts or data); low if it’s tangential, unsupported by any literature, or not actionable ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)).                                                                          |

**Testability** and **falsifiability** ensure the hypothesis is scientifically meaningful – it must make clear predictions that could be tested and potentially proven false ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore)). A hypothesis scoring high here would be specific enough to design an experiment or query existing data for validation. **Novelty** rewards insight that goes beyond the obvious. We discourage “hypotheses” that merely restate known correlations or slightly tweak published ideas ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)). **Biological plausibility** acts as a reality check: even a novel idea must not violate known biology (e.g. a proposed drug mechanism that contradicts known physiology would score low) ([Large-Scale Validation of Hypothesis Generation Systems via Candidate Ranking - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9248026/#:~:text=evaluation%20framework%20for%20the%20purpose,generate%20a%20set%20of%20candidate)). Finally, **relevance** gauges whether pursuing this hypothesis could matter to the field – does it connect with documented observations (e.g. patterns in PubMed abstracts) or address an outstanding question? A relevant hypothesis might integrate scattered findings into a coherent, testable claim, whereas an irrelevant one is unlinked to any known context ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)).

Each criterion can be initially scored on a normalized scale (e.g. 0–10 or 0–20 points), with rubric guidelines for each. For example, **Novelty** could be scored by checking literature: 10 if no directly similar hypothesis is found (truly novel), 5 if moderate similarities exist (incremental idea), and 0 if the relationship is already well-known. The sum is converted to a percentage (out of 100). In practice, we expect truly exceptional hypotheses (high novelty yet plausible and testable) to score in the 80–100 range, whereas mundane or unscientific ones score low. These scores help prioritize which hypotheses warrant further exploration.

## System Architecture Overview

To handle millions of hypotheses, the scoring system is designed as a **multi-stage automated pipeline** that combines LLM reasoning with structured biomedical data (**_Figure 1_**). It operates as follows:

([image]()) _Figure 1: Proposed architecture of the automated hypothesis scoring system. LLM-generated hypotheses are each evaluated by incorporating external knowledge context, LLM-based analysis of criteria, and an ensemble scoring aggregator. The system is largely automated, with an option for human experts to review borderline or high-impact cases (dashed path)._

**1. Hypothesis Ingestion:** The pipeline begins with candidate hypotheses generated by LLMs (or other sources). These are free-form scientific statements (e.g. _“Protein X activation reduces inflammation in disease Y via pathway Z”_) that need scoring. Because of the high volume, hypotheses are queued in a database or message stream for batch processing.

**2. External Knowledge Retrieval:** For each hypothesis, the system automatically gathers supporting context from external data sources. This step enriches the hypothesis with evidence and domain knowledge before scoring. We use a combination of:

- **Biomedical Knowledge Graphs:** The system queries knowledge graphs (KGs) of known biomedical relationships (e.g. Unified Medical Language System, SemMedDB, Hetionet) for any connections between entities in the hypothesis. If the hypothesis states a novel relationship (say between a gene and a disease), the KG might reveal indirect paths or intermediate nodes linking them ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=entity%20,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). For example, if _Gene A_ is known to stimulate _Protein B_ and _Protein B_ is known to cause _Disease C_, this path suggests plausibility for a hypothesis that _Gene A influences Disease C_ ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=more%20specific%20kind%20of%20knowledge,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). The presence of a multi-step connection in a KG can bolster _biological plausibility_ (the idea is grounded in existing biology), while the absence of any path might indicate high novelty (or a need for caution if it contradicts known links). Graph algorithms can also compute a plausibility score based on network topology (e.g. number of supporting paths, edge confidence) ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20take,entities%20participates%20in%20a%20particular)) ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20we%20build%20a%20large,using%20the%20rule%20based)).

- **Biomedical Ontologies (MeSH, GO, etc.):** Ontologies provide structured vocabularies and hierarchical relationships. The system maps hypothesis terms to ontology concepts (e.g. MeSH terms for diseases, Gene Ontology for molecular functions). This serves two purposes: (a) **Synonym normalization** – ensuring the LLM and retrieval modules consider all synonyms (e.g. “heart attack” vs “myocardial infarction”); and (b) **Contextual relevance** – e.g., if a gene and a process appear in the same GO biological process category or a disease and treatment share MeSH categories, it hints the hypothesis is grounded in a recognized context. Ontologies can thus inform _relevance_ scoring (if a hypothesis links distant ontology branches, it might be less conventional, affecting plausibility).

- **Literature and Citation Networks:** The system leverages text-mining tools (like **PubTator** or NCBI’s APIs) to scan PubMed abstracts for evidence or counter-evidence. It looks for co-occurrence of key entities, existing experimental results, or any published hypotheses about similar relationships. If multiple papers independently report observations aligning with the hypothesis, it strengthens plausibility and relevance. Conversely, if prior research has _refuted_ a similar claim, that would significantly lower the score. We also use citation networks: e.g. if the entities in the hypothesis have been jointly discussed or cited in many papers, the idea may not be novel (lower novelty score but possibly higher plausibility since it’s discussed often). This automated literature connection is inspired by literature-based discovery techniques – linking disparate findings to suggest new hypotheses ([Large-Scale Validation of Hypothesis Generation Systems via Candidate Ranking - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9248026/#:~:text=scientists%20miss%20important%20findings,9%5D%2C%20few%20automated)) ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=entity%20,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). The system can harness databases like **SemMedDB** (a database of semantic predications from all PubMed abstracts) to quickly check if a hypothesized relation (or any part of it) has been stated or can be inferred from published evidence ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=more%20specific%20kind%20of%20knowledge,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). A lack of any mention indicates novelty; presence of partial evidence indicates plausibility.

- **Experimental and Omics Data:** Where applicable, the system taps into structured experimental databases (e.g. **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)** for gene expression patterns, **BioGRID** for protein interactions, **CTD** for chemical-disease interactions). For example, if a hypothesis is _“Gene X ameliorates Disease Y”_, the system can check if Gene X is differentially expressed in Disease Y samples (from GEO) or if Gene X’s protein interacts with known disease pathways (from BioGRID). Finding supporting experimental signals would increase _biological plausibility_ and _testability_ (perhaps data exists to test it immediately), whereas contradictory data (e.g. gene X is not expressed in relevant tissue) would flag the hypothesis as implausible. These automated data lookups transform abstract hypotheses into evidence-backed assertions where possible.

- **Paper Embeddings and Semantic Similarity:** We maintain an embedding index of biomedical publications (e.g. using SPECTER or BioBERT embeddings for paper abstracts). The hypothesis (as a short text) is embedded and nearest-neighbor search finds semantically similar papers or sections. This helps retrieve relevant background: if similar hypotheses have been tested, the results can inform scoring (validated or refuted?). It also helps in judging _novelty_ – a completely orthogonal hypothesis will have few close matches in embedding space (novel idea), whereas one that clusters with many existing abstracts might be a known idea. By combining keyword-based and embedding-based retrieval, we reduce oversight of relevant evidence.

**3. LLM-Based Evaluation Module:** After gathering context, an LLM (or ensemble of models) evaluates the hypothesis against the **scoring criteria**. The hypothesis text plus any retrieved snippets (e.g. key sentences from literature, knowledge graph findings, data stats) are fed into a prompt for an expert-level LLM (such as GPT-4 or a biomedical fine-tuned model) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20inspired%20by%20recent%20research,4%20in%20Section%C2%A03.4)). The LLM is instructed to act as a _scientific evaluator_, producing a structured analysis: e.g., it may output a tuple of scores (0–10 for each criterion) along with a rationale for each. Recent studies show that GPT-4 can perform multi-facet evaluation aligned with human judgments ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20inspired%20by%20recent%20research,4%20in%20Section%C2%A03.4)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=We%20develope%20multidimensional%20metrics%20for,substantial%20role%20in%20hypothesis%20evaluation)). We will prompt the model to explicitly consider each criterion:

- _Testability:_ The LLM identifies what experiment or dataset could test the hypothesis. If it can readily propose a feasible experiment (e.g. _“This could be tested by knocking out Gene X in a mouse model of Disease Y and measuring inflammation markers”_), it will lean toward a high testability score ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)). If the hypothesis is too vague (\*“improve wellness” without measurable endpoints) or requires technology beyond current capability, it notes low testability.

- _Falsifiability:_ The LLM checks if the hypothesis is formulated in a way that it could be proven wrong by some observation ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore)). For example, a hypothesis that *“Mutation in gene X will *always* cause disease Y”* is falsifiable (one could find counterexamples), whereas _“Disease Y occurs due to unknown supernatural causes”_ is not scientific. The LLM, channeling a methodological critic, would mark unfalsifiable or tautological statements with a poor score.

- _Novelty:_ The LLM compares the hypothesis to retrieved literature. If the retrieval step found virtually no direct references, and the LLM’s own knowledge (up to its training cutoff) doesn’t recall such a claim, it will highlight the hypothesis as novel. We also fine-tune or few-shot prompt the model with examples of “trivial vs. non-trivial” hypotheses so it learns to detect when a hypothesis is just a small variation of known facts ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)). A novel hypothesis might get commentary like _“This proposes a new role for pathway Z in Disease Y, which has not been reported in the literature I’ve seen”_ and a high novelty score. If it’s something well-documented, the LLM will down-score novelty.

- _Biological Plausibility:_ The LLM examines the logical consistency of the hypothesis with known mechanisms ([Large-Scale Validation of Hypothesis Generation Systems via Candidate Ranking - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9248026/#:~:text=evaluation%20framework%20for%20the%20purpose,generate%20a%20set%20of%20candidate)). It uses the retrieved evidence: e.g., _“Gene X is a pro-inflammatory cytokine and Disease Y is an inflammatory condition, so it’s plausible that inhibiting X could ameliorate Y”_. It will also note any contradictions: _“However, according to dataset ABC, Gene X is not expressed in the affected tissue, undermining plausibility.”_ By weighing such facts, the LLM assigns a plausibility score. This step effectively mimics a domain expert reasoning about whether the hypothesis _could_ be true in light of existing biology.

- _Relevance:_ The LLM checks how connected the hypothesis is to ongoing research or practical impact ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)). For example, if the hypothesis addresses a major disease or an open question identified in review papers, it’s highly relevant. It may cross-check if the hypothesis relates to recent findings (perhaps using the abstract of a recent paper retrieved). If a hypothesis seems out of left field with no clear bearing on known issues, it’s less useful. The LLM’s analysis could note: _“This hypothesis builds on a recently observed correlation in transcriptomic data, making it very relevant to current Alzheimer’s research”_ vs. _“This hypothesis about an ancient pathway in an obscure organism has little connection to human health, hence lower relevance.”_

The LLM’s evaluation yields **intermediate scores** per criterion (which can be scaled to our weightings) and an explanation trace. Notably, to ensure **transparency and trust**, the system retains these rationales and any evidence the LLM cited. Researchers can later inspect _why_ a high-scoring hypothesis was deemed testable or novel, etc., which is crucial for adoption.

**4. Ensemble Scoring and Aggregation:** The system aggregates the evaluations to produce a final numeric score out of 100. To maximize accuracy and reduce bias, we employ an **ensemble of scoring methods**:

- Multiple LLMs (or multiple prompts) can evaluate the same hypothesis independently. For instance, one might use a GPT-4 based evaluator and another a domain-specific model (like a fine-tuned BioGPT) or even different prompting styles. This _ensemble of LLM judges_ provides a form of cross-check. We can average the scores or use a voting schema for each criterion. Any large discrepancies trigger a flag for review. Research shows that _self-consistency_ (averaging multiple reasoning paths) improves reliability of LLM outputs ([Simulate Scientific Reasoning with Multiple Large Language Models: An Application to Alzheimer’s Disease Combinatorial Therapy - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11661384/#:~:text=Our%20proposed%20framework%20achieved%20a,is%20not%20a%20viable%20option)).
- In addition to LLMs, we integrate **algorithmic sub-scores**: e.g., a knowledge graph-based plausibility score (from the graph mining in step 2), a bibliometric novelty score (based on literature counts), etc. These quantitative signals act as another “voter” in the ensemble. For example, if the KG suggests a short path connecting the hypothesis entities and the LLM also felt it was plausible, the agreement boosts confidence in the plausibility criterion. Conversely, if an LLM judged something plausible but the knowledge graph finds a glaring contradiction (perhaps an established fact the LLM missed), the ensemble can reduce the score accordingly. By combining symbolic knowledge-driven metrics with LLM reasoning, we capitalize on their complementary strengths ([Simulate Scientific Reasoning with Multiple Large Language Models: An Application to Alzheimer’s Disease Combinatorial Therapy - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11661384/#:~:text=Our%20proposed%20framework%20achieved%20a,is%20not%20a%20viable%20option)) ([Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20we%20build%20a%20large,using%20the%20rule%20based)).
- The aggregator applies the pre-defined weights to each criterion’s final agreed score (for instance, a weighted sum giving 20% influence to each criterion, as set in Table 1). This yields the composite score (0–100). The aggregation module can also normalize scores if different evaluators use different scales. The result is a ranked list of hypotheses with their scores and possibly a breakdown (like _85/100 – Testability:18, Falsifiability:17, Novelty:20, Plausibility:15, Relevance:15_).

Crucially, the ensemble approach and multi-agent LLM evaluation improve **robustness**. They mitigate idiosyncrasies of any single model (reducing the chance an LLM’s hallucination or blind spot skews the result). As a recent multi-LLM study noted, incorporating peer-review style critique and self-consistency dramatically improved accuracy in scientific inference tasks ([Simulate Scientific Reasoning with Multiple Large Language Models: An Application to Alzheimer’s Disease Combinatorial Therapy - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11661384/#:~:text=Our%20proposed%20framework%20achieved%20a,is%20not%20a%20viable%20option)). Our design embraces this by having (virtually) a panel of AI “reviewers” adjudicate each hypothesis.

**5. Human-in-the-Loop (Optional):** While the system is _fully automated_ in routine operation, we include a mechanism for human expert intervention when needed. The scoring aggregator can flag certain hypotheses for manual review under conditions such as:

- **Ambiguity or Uncertainty:** If the ensemble’s judges disagree widely (e.g. one LLM says highly plausible while another says implausible), indicating the hypothesis is contentious or the evidence is inconclusive. Rather than assign an unreliable score, the system flags this hypothesis as “Needs review”. A human expert can then examine the conflicting evidence and adjust the evaluation.
- **Top-N Candidates:** Researchers might want to sanity-check the top-scoring 0.1% of hypotheses before investing resources. The system can present the top candidates with the LLM explanations and evidence snippets. A domain scientist can quickly vet them, effectively functioning as an extra validation layer.
- **Novel but High-Risk Ideas:** If a hypothesis scores very high on novelty but moderate on plausibility (a potentially groundbreaking but speculative idea), the system might flag it so that experts can decide if it’s worth exploring despite weaker plausibility. Human insight can sometimes spot subtle flaws or genius that automated systems might mis-rank.
- **Periodic Calibration:** Experts can review a random sample of scored hypotheses to ensure the system’s criteria are being applied correctly. Their feedback (e.g. “this hypothesis should have scored higher on relevance”) can be fed back to update the LLM prompts or weights (continuous improvement).

The human-in-loop component is designed to be minimal (perhaps reviewing only a tiny fraction of cases), so that **throughput remains high**. The system can process the bulk of hypotheses unattended, and only a manageable subset requires human attention. Over time, as confidence in the automated scores grows (and as the LLMs get further fine-tuned on human feedback), the reliance on human intervention can be dialed down.

## External Data Sources to Enhance Scoring

A key design aspect is leveraging **external knowledge** to ground the scoring in facts. Here we detail how various resources are integrated, and their role in boosting scoring accuracy:

- **Knowledge Graphs & Databases:** We integrate biomedical KGs such as UMLS (which links diseases, drugs, genes with relationship types), SemMedDB (subject-predicate-object triples from literature) ([
  Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC
  ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20we%20build%20a%20large,using%20the%20rule%20based)), and domain-specific graphs (e.g. drug–gene–disease networks). By mapping hypothesis components onto these graphs, we can algorithmically evaluate connectivity. For example, a hypothesis “Drug A treats Disease B” can be scored for plausibility by checking known paths: Drug A → Protein target → Pathway → Disease B. If such a path exists or Drug A and Disease B share many intermediate connections, it quantitatively suggests plausibility ([
  Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC
  ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=more%20specific%20kind%20of%20knowledge,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). If the graph is completely disconnected between A and B, the hypothesis is either very novel or nonsensical. Additionally, knowledge graphs can be used for **novelty detection**: if the direct relation (A treats B) already exists as an edge in the knowledge graph (or in a curated database like DrugBank), then the hypothesis isn’t novel at all (score it low on novelty, perhaps exclude it as it’s already known). Graph algorithms (like link prediction models) could even estimate how likely an unobserved edge is to be true ([
  Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC
  ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=We%20employed%20semantic%20graph%20patterns,for%20weakly%20supervised%20relation%20prediction)) – effectively giving an independent plausibility score that we incorporate.

- **Biomedical Ontologies:** Resources like **MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)**, **Gene Ontology (GO)**, and **Disease Ontology** provide structured domain knowledge. Our system uses them to ensure proper interpretation of terms and to find related concepts. For instance, if a hypothesis involves a gene and a process, GO can tell if that gene is involved in that process or related ones (supporting plausibility). MeSH can tell if two concepts have been indexed with similar terms (supporting relevance). Ontologies also help in expanding the search space: an LLM might not realize that “vitamin C” is related to “ascorbic acid” – but by linking both to a common ontology ID, the retrieval can gather evidence for either term. This reduces missed evidence and improves the LLM’s evaluation. Furthermore, ontologies could contribute to scoring _testability_: e.g., an ontology of experimental techniques might be queried to see if appropriate assays exist for the entities involved (if a hypothesis involves a process for which no lab assay is available, testability is lower).

- **Citation and Text Networks:** We use networks like citation graphs (which paper cites which) and co-authorship or keyword networks to contextualize relevance. If a new hypothesis connects domains that have been largely disjoint, it might be especially novel (transdisciplinary insight). Alternatively, if two concepts in the hypothesis are frequently discussed together in literature (measured via co-citation frequency or appearing in the same MeSH categories), then the hypothesis might be more incremental. Additionally, text mining outputs like **co-occurrence networks** from PubMed (e.g. how often gene X and disease Y appear in the same abstract) give a clue: a zero co-occurrence might mean novel connection (or one that nobody studied), whereas high co-occurrence means it’s already a known association. We incorporate such signals into _novelty_ and _relevance_ scoring.

- **Semantic Meta-data (SemMedDB & PubTator):** **SemMedDB** provides millions of triples (X -> relation -> Y) extracted from PubMed ([
  Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC
  ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=Instead%2C%20we%20build%20a%20large,using%20the%20rule%20based)). If a hypothesis can be phrased as a relation (e.g. _X causes Y_), we check if SemMedDB already has that triple asserted by some paper. If yes, then the hypothesis is actually something already in the literature (novelty = 0, but plausibility high if many papers assert it). If not, we look for any supporting triples: e.g. X -> _affects_ -> Z and Z -> _affects_ -> Y chain, as evidence ([
  Exploiting Semantic Patterns over Biomedical Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Treatment and Causative Relations - PMC
  ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6070294/#:~:text=more%20specific%20kind%20of%20knowledge,treats%20predicates%20in%20that%20order)). **PubTator** annotations help identify all genes, diseases, chemicals in the hypothesis and retrieve sentences mentioning them. This provides direct text evidence that the LLM can cite when scoring plausibility or relevance. Essentially, SemMedDB and PubTator act as surrogates for a deep literature review by an expert, done in seconds.

- **Experimental Data Repositories:** The system links to data such as gene expression profiles (from GEO), protein-protein interactions (BioGRID), genomics studies, clinical trial databases, etc. The idea is to check real-world data for consistency with the hypothesis. For example, suppose an LLM generates a hypothesis that _“Compound X will downregulate gene Y in cancer cells”_. We could check LINCS/L1000 datasets or GEO for experiments where compound X was applied to cells and see if gene Y expression went down. If yes, that’s direct evidence supporting the hypothesis (huge boost to plausibility and testability, since data exists to test it). If the data contradicts (Y was upregulated), then either the hypothesis is likely false or context-dependent (falsifiability: such data could falsify it). While we cannot do full experimental validation for millions of hypotheses, these data checks act as a filter to catch those hypotheses that _fail_ against known experimental results or, conversely, those that are instantly verifiable from existing data. This greatly increases precision, focusing attention on hypotheses that survive known evidence.

- **NLP-Based Document Embeddings:** By encoding papers and even hypotheses as vectors, we utilize modern NLP (e.g. SciBERT, BioSentVec) to measure semantic similarity. If a hypothesis is closely embedded to a set of papers, we can automatically gather those as context (which the LLM might use to see if the hypothesis was anticipated by those works). We can also train a simple classifier in embedding space that predicts “likely true vs false” hypothesis based on where it lies relative to known facts (though this is experimental). More straightforwardly, clustering hypotheses by embeddings can group similar ones, which helps in **scalability** (e.g., handle duplicate or highly similar hypotheses together to avoid redundant work, or diversify top picks by not picking ten variations of the same underlying idea).

All these external sources enrich the evaluation. They function as a knowledge augmentation for the LLM and as independent scoring channels. The design ensures that each hypothesis is not assessed in a vacuum of the LLM’s training data (which may be outdated or incomplete), but in the full light of current scientific databases. This is essential because LLMs alone might produce _plausible-sounding but incorrect_ hypotheses; by grounding in external evidence, we improve accuracy and trustworthiness ([Simulate Scientific Reasoning with Multiple Large Language Models: An Application to Alzheimer’s Disease Combinatorial Therapy - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11661384/#:~:text=Our%20proposed%20framework%20achieved%20a,is%20not%20a%20viable%20option)).

## Ensemble Scoring and Multi-Agent Adjudication

To achieve high accuracy, our system uses ensemble strategies and even a **multi-agent LLM approach** for adjudication of scores. The rationale is to mirror the scientific peer-review process: multiple “reviewers” evaluate the hypothesis so that the final decision is well-considered ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=existing%20knowledge%20and%20offers%20a,and%20iterative%20process%20of%20refinement)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=hypothesis%20is%20finalized%2C%20it%20undergoes,and%20iterative%20process%20of%20refinement)).

- **LLM Committee:** We deploy multiple LLM agents with different specialties. For instance, one agent (“Methodologist”) focuses on testability/falsifiability, another (“Domain Expert”) focuses on biological plausibility, and another (“Innovator”) assesses novelty and significance. Each agent is prompted in a way that emphasizes their perspective. This division of labor ensures that, say, an agent concentrating on falsifiability will not gloss over a subtle logical flaw, while the novelty-focused agent might be more imaginative and less constrained by known facts. After their independent assessments, a final “Chair” agent or a simple algorithm aggregates their scores. This _multi-agent framework_ has precedent in recent work where an Analyst-Engineer-Scientist-Critic paradigm was used to generate hypotheses collaboratively ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Role%20Design%20%20In%20our,This%20organized%20materials%20then)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Engineer%E2%80%99s%20findings%20with%20the%20original,and%20iterative%20process%20of%20refinement)). In our case, the agents are collaborating to _evaluate_ a given hypothesis. If the agents’ scores diverge significantly, the Chair agent can initiate a brief debate – e.g., ask each agent to justify their score and perhaps adjust if convinced by others’ arguments (this can be done by another round of prompting where each agent’s rationale is shared). Such a mechanism can catch cases where, for example, the novelty agent scored low because they recalled a similar known fact, but the domain expert points out a nuanced difference that makes it novel after all. By adjudicating differences, the multi-agent system yields a more balanced and justified score.

- **Algorithmic + LLM Ensemble:** Alongside the LLM committee, we consider the algorithmic metrics (from KGs, literature, etc.) as additional “voters.” We might implement a simple ensemble model (like a regression or classification) that takes features: LLM-predicted scores and evidence-based features, to output a refined score. This model can be trained on a small set of hypotheses that have known outcomes or human-provided scores, learning the optimal combination. For example, an ensemble might learn that if the LLM gives high novelty but the literature count feature is also high (meaning not actually novel), to weight the literature feature more to adjust novelty down. Conversely, if LLM plausibility is low but KG shows strong supporting path, perhaps adjust plausibility up slightly. The ensemble thus guards against any single knowledge source’s bias. Studies have found that combining knowledge-based and neural evaluations can improve correlation with expert judgments ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Evaluation%20Metrics%20Given%20the%20inherent,Papineni)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=metrics%20to%20evaluate%20the%20quality,incorporation%20of%20diverse%20data%20sources)). We will validate the ensemble’s performance on a test set of hypotheses (e.g., from recent papers or expert rankings) and iteratively refine weighting.

- **Self-Consistency and Redundancy:** We incorporate the technique of self-consistency for the LLM evaluators ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=match%20at%20L67%20and%202,use%20may%20not%20always%20lead)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Few,However%2C%20it%E2%80%99s)). This means each LLM agent might be run _N_ times with variations (different random seeds or prompt phrasing) to see if it consistently gives the same judgement. If an agent’s answers are unstable (varies each run), the system notes uncertainty. Stable high scores are more credible than a case where one run the agent scored 9/10 and another 3/10 (indicating it’s borderline or context-dependent). This information could be used to decide human review or at least to down-weight very inconsistent evaluations. Redundancy in evaluation (multiple passes, multiple models) reduces the chance of an outlier score. It is akin to doing multiple replicates of an experiment to be sure of the result.

Using an ensemble and multi-agent approach does come with computational cost, but it is embarrassingly parallel and can be distributed. For millions of hypotheses, we might not do a full multi-agent analysis on _every_ single one – perhaps a cheaper single-model pass to filter the top 5% first, then apply the heavier multi-agent scoring on those. This two-tier strategy preserves scalability while still benefiting from ensemble accuracy on the most promising hypotheses.

## Scalability and Performance Considerations

Designing for **millions of hypotheses** requires careful engineering of the pipeline:

- We will use **batch processing and parallelization** at every step. For example, the external retrieval (which may involve many API calls or database queries) will be optimized by caching common queries and using asynchronous IO. Many hypotheses might share terms (e.g. numerous hypotheses about the same gene), so the system can batch queries for that gene’s info once and reuse it.
- **Indexing and pre-computation:** Building indexes like the vector database for papers, or pre-computing a knowledge graph shortest paths index, significantly speeds up the retrieval step. We might maintain an in-memory graph database that can answer connectivity queries in milliseconds. Similarly, maintaining an ELMo or SciBERT embedding for each unique entity or concept can allow quick similarity computations rather than on-the-fly model inference.
- **Tiered evaluation:** As noted, not all hypotheses may need equal scrutiny. We can implement a fast initial pass that uses lightweight models or heuristics to prune obvious low-quality hypotheses. For instance, if a hypothesis contains internal contradictions or fails a basic plausibility rule (like “Drug X treats disease Y” when drug X was discontinued for toxicity in that disease), we can discard or deprioritize it early. A small transformer model fine-tuned to detect nonsensical hypotheses could serve this triage role with negligible cost per hypothesis. After this pruning, the more expensive LLM evaluation and retrieval is done on the remainder. This ensures we don’t waste resources on hopeless cases.
- **Resource management:** Evaluating millions of hypotheses even with an LLM like GPT-4 is cost-prohibitive if done naïvely. If using an API-based LLM, we’d integrate cost-aware logic: e.g., route simpler cases to a cheaper model (GPT-3.5 or an open-source model) and only use the top-tier model for cases where subtle judgement is needed. We can also explore model distillation – using GPT-4 on a sample to label data and train a smaller model to mimic its scoring. Such a distilled model could then quickly score millions with occasional GPT-4 audits for quality control.
- **Streaming and updates:** The system could be run in a streaming mode where new hypotheses (or updates to knowledge sources) continuously flow in. Using a message queue and microservice architecture, each stage can scale horizontally. For instance, multiple instances of the LLM evaluation service can run in parallel to handle large batches, each pulling tasks from a queue. This design would allow practically unbounded scaling by adding more compute nodes.
- **Error control and statistical rigor:** Inspired by Popper et al.’s sequential falsification approach ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore)), our system can incorporate statistical testing if needed. For example, if we treat each hypothesis evaluation as an experiment, we could control false positive rate by calibrating the scoring thresholds (perhaps using a hold-out set of random hypotheses known to be false to see what scores they get, and setting a cutoff above that). Ensuring that a score of, say, 90 truly means a very high likelihood of being a sound hypothesis may involve some empirical calibration. This way, if millions of hypotheses are scored, the top 1% truly represent the cream of the crop with minimal false positives.

Overall, the architecture is built to **scale rigorously**. By combining automated knowledge retrieval, parallel LLM reasoning, and smart filtering, we ensure even a vast hypothesis set can be processed in a reasonable time (e.g. distributing across a compute cluster or cloud). The result is a system that extends scientists’ ability to vet ideas at the speed of machines, while upholding the standards of scientific validity.

## Integration into an LLM-Driven Hypothesis Generation Pipeline

Finally, we consider how this scoring system plugs into a broader _hypothesis-generation pipeline_ to maximize utility for researchers. In a typical pipeline:

1. **LLM Hypothesis Generation:** An LLM (possibly guided by a researcher’s prompt or an autonomous agent reading literature) produces a list of novel hypotheses. Recent work has shown LLMs can generate hypotheses that later get validated by new literature ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=propose%20four%20novel%20metrics%20grounded,for%20careful%20consideration%20of%20the)). However, this raw output can be noisy or overwhelming.
2. **Automated Scoring (Our System):** Immediately after generation, our scoring system evaluates each hypothesis. The pipeline can be configured so that only hypotheses above a certain score threshold are forwarded, or it can rank them and take the top _N_. This filtering is crucial; it turns a huge list into a curated shortlist. For example, if an LLM proposes 10,000 hypotheses about a disease, the system might select the top 50 based on score for further analysis.
3. **Feedback to Generation:** The scores (and rationales) can feed back into the hypothesis generator in a closed-loop system. For instance, if certain types of hypotheses consistently score low (e.g., those lacking falsifiability), the generation module can adjust to propose more testable variants. One could implement an **ensemble of generators and evaluators**: multiple LLMs generate hypotheses, our evaluator scores them, and a controller agent uses those scores to decide which areas to explore more. This is analogous to evolutionary algorithms where hypotheses are “mutated” and “selected” based on a fitness score – here the score is scientific merit. Over successive rounds, the pipeline could converge on highly promising hypotheses by refining or combining top-scoring ones.
4. **Presentation to Researchers:** The pipeline delivers the top-ranked hypotheses to human researchers in a digestible format. Each hypothesis could be accompanied by:

   - Its **score breakdown** (so the scientist sees, for example, it’s very novel and testable but maybe with moderate plausibility).
   - A brief **justification** automatically generated from the LLM analysis, e.g. _“Rank 1 Hypothesis: Protein ABC might reduce tau aggregation in Alzheimer’s (Score 92)._ **Rationale:** _Testable via existing mouse models (testability 19/20). Falsifiable by checking if tau levels change with ABC (18/20). Novelty is high (no prior literature linking ABC to tau, 20/20). Plausibility supported by ABC’s known role in protein folding (17/20). Relevant to Alzheimer’s pathology (18/20). Key supporting studies: Smith et al. 2022 observed upregulation of ABC in brains, etc.”_ This rich explanation not only builds trust, but gives researchers a starting point (citations, data pointers) to delve deeper ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20inspired%20by%20recent%20research,4%20in%20Section%C2%A03.4)).
   - **Links to evidence**: e.g., direct links to PubMed abstracts or datasets that were used in scoring. This allows the researcher to quickly verify and gather materials to plan experiments.

5. **Experimental or Further Validation:** For top hypotheses, the pipeline could interface with lab management software or simulation tools. For example, if an in-silico screening or a wet-lab experiment can be automated (as in high-throughput screening or using robotics), the pipeline might directly suggest an experiment. The _Popper_ system ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore)) goes this next step by automating falsification experiments. Our scoring system complements such frameworks: we triage the inputs for an automated _validation_ stage. Only the highest scoring (and thus most likely fruitful) hypotheses would be handed off to expensive validation processes, making the entire discovery pipeline more efficient.

By integrating in this manner, the scoring system serves as an **AI filter and advisor** in the workflow of hypothesis generation. It maximizes utility by saving researchers time – rather than sifting through hundreds of AI-generated ideas, they receive a concise list of those that meet rigorous scientific standards. Moreover, the system can adapt to researchers’ needs; for instance, the score threshold or weighting could be tuned to a specific project (maybe a researcher cares more about novelty and less about immediate testability, so weights can be adjusted accordingly). The pipeline could even allow a feedback loop where the researcher’s selections (which hypothesis they choose to pursue) are fed back as reinforcement signals to the system, gradually aligning the scoring with what the human collaborators find valuable.

**Recommendations for Deployment:** We recommend initially deploying the system on narrower domains (e.g. hypotheses in cancer biology) to fine-tune its performance. Engage domain experts to review a sample of scored outputs and adjust the prompts/weights for optimal alignment with expert opinion (this could involve a few human-in-the-loop calibration rounds). Once validated, integrate the system with the LLM generators in an end-to-end fashion. Ensure that the system is regularly updated with the latest knowledge – e.g., update the literature database and knowledge graphs so that relevance and plausibility are always judged against current science (LLMs alone might be frozen in time). Finally, implement a user interface for researchers that highlights the **value added** by the scoring: clear scores, explanations, and one-click access to evidence. This will encourage adoption and trust, turning the pipeline into a practical tool for accelerating biomedical discovery.

## Justification and Conclusion

In designing this automated hypothesis scoring system, we prioritized scientific rigor, scalability, and integration. By defining clear criteria grounded in the philosophy of science (testability/falsifiability per Popper ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=make%20manual%20validation%20impractical,Furthermore))) and research practice (novelty, plausibility, relevance ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=)) ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=))), the scoring is **transparent and justifiable**. Each score has meaning, and we can defend why a hypothesis was rated a certain way. The use of diverse external data ensures the system’s judgments are informed by _the sum of human biomedical knowledge_ up to now, not just the LLM’s training data. This dramatically increases accuracy – our system would catch, for instance, that a “novel” hypothesis about a gene-disease link is actually already in a 2024 paper, because it saw the evidence, whereas an uninformed LLM might wrongly call it novel.

The scalability to millions of hypotheses is achieved through a combination of engineering optimizations and intelligent triaging. Recent experiments with LLMs in hypothesis generation and validation (such as multi-agent reasoning frameworks ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Role%20Design%20%20In%20our,This%20organized%20materials%20then)) ([Simulate Scientific Reasoning with Multiple Large Language Models: An Application to Alzheimer’s Disease Combinatorial Therapy - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11661384/#:~:text=Our%20proposed%20framework%20achieved%20a,is%20not%20a%20viable%20option))) demonstrate that such automated systems can indeed handle large volumes and still produce quality outcomes. Huang _et al._ (2025) showed an agent-based approach could validate complex biological hypotheses with 10-fold time reduction compared to humans ([GitHub - snap-stanford/POPPER: Automated Hypothesis Testing with Agentic Sequential Falsifications](https://github.com/snap-stanford/POPPER#:~:text=Popper%27s%20principle%20of%20falsification%2C%20Popper,reducing%20time%20by%2010%20folds)) – this underscores that our vision of an automated scoring pipeline is feasible and can drastically accelerate the scientific cycle.

By incorporating ensemble and multi-agent methods, we also address the uncertainty and variability inherent in AI outputs. The scoring system is not a black box but more like a **committee of experts (in silico)**, each bringing different data and perspectives, and collectively arriving at a reasoned evaluation. This approach echoes how human scientists would evaluate a new idea – checking literature, considering theory, debating pros and cons – but at machine speed and scale.

In conclusion, the proposed system provides a **rigorous, automated triage** for LLM-generated biomedical hypotheses. It assigns a quantitative merit score based on scientific criteria, enabling downstream prioritization. By integrating it into the hypothesis generation pipeline, we ensure that the creativity of LLMs (which can generate innumerable ideas) is effectively harnessed and distilled into actionable insights. This symbiosis of LLM generation and LLM+knowledge evaluation can become a powerful _“discovery engine”_ for biomedical research ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=propose%20four%20novel%20metrics%20grounded,for%20careful%20consideration%20of%20the)). Researchers could focus their efforts on top-ranked hypotheses, increasing the chance of breakthroughs hidden in the mass of possibilities. The system’s design balances innovation and caution: it encourages novel ideas (rewarding novelty) but tempers them with scientific credibility (requiring plausibility and testability).

Future work will involve continuously updating the scoring models as new validation data comes in (e.g., if certain scored hypotheses get tested in the lab, we feed the outcomes back to further train the system). We will also explore extending the criteria schema – for example, adding an _“Impact” or “Significance”_ dimension ([Large Language Models as Biomedical Hypothesis Generators: A Comprehensive Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.08940v1#:~:text=Relevance%3A%20How%20closely%20is%20the,to%20the%20topic%20or%20question)) to favor hypotheses that, if true, would have high clinical or theoretical impact. Additionally, as more multi-modal data becomes available (imaging, clinical records), those can be integrated into the evidence retrieval to evaluate hypotheses involving phenotypes or patient outcomes.

Ultimately, by deploying this automated scoring system, we aim to **maximize the utility of LLM-driven hypothesis generation**, turning a deluge of AI-proposed ideas into a ranked, evidence-supported shortlist that drives efficient and meaningful scientific inquiry. The marriage of LLM creativity with automated rigor can help scientists navigate the ever-expanding biomedical knowledge space and uncover the next big discoveries hidden within.
