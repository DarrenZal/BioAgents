  "dcterms:abstract": "Bloom syndrome (BSyn, OMIM #210900) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by growth restriction, sun sensitivity, insulin resistance, mild immune deficiency, and increased risk of early-onset malignancy. BSyn cases are caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous pathogenic variants (PV) in BLM, with over 547 different PV identified in ClinVar. The Bloom Syndrome Registry (BSR) recently reported that 53% of participants had developed cancer, with hematologic malignancies being the most common cancer risk. While several studies have shown no association of carriers having increased risk, recent studies have identified increased risk of cancers in BLM PV carriers such as colorectal cancer, breast cancer and mesothelioma.",
